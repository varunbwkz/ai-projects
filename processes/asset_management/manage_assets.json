        "Log in to your Brandworkz account to access the DAM module.",
        "Navigate to the folder containing assets you want to manage.",
        "Use the Action Bar at the top to access management tools: Download, Upload, Add to album, Share, Edit, Move, Trash, and Copy.",
        "Select multiple assets using checkboxes or use 'Select all' for bulk management operations.",
        "Double-click any asset to open the Full-Screen Asset Popup (FSAP) for detailed management options.",
        "In the FSAP, use the Asset Info tab to view and edit file information, tags, and metadata.",
        "Access the Comments tab to add feedback or annotations to specific parts of an asset.",
        "Use the Insights tab to track asset usage statistics and monitor where assets are being used.",
        "For maintenance tasks, click the cog icon to access options like 'Regenerate thumbnail' and 'Regenerate asset info'.",
        "Use the Side Bar by dragging assets into it for quick operations across different folders.",
        "The Side Bar allows you to download, share, and relate assets without creating an album first.",
        "Create folders and albums to organize assets by project, campaign, or category.",
        "Regularly review assets to ensure they remain relevant and update metadata as needed.",
        "Archive or delete obsolete assets to maintain an organized library."

    "troubleshooting": [
        "If thumbnails don't display correctly, use the 'Regenerate thumbnail' option in the cog menu.",
        "If asset information is incorrect or missing, use 'Regenerate asset info' in the cog menu.",
        "If you can't find an asset, try different search terms or check if it's been moved to another folder."
