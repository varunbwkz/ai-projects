  "steps": [
    "Log in to your Brandworkz account with your credentials. If you don't have an account yet, you'll need to create one or ask your administrator for access.",
    "Navigate to the desired folder where you want to upload the asset. This is NOT the 'Assets Section' or 'Upload Section' - you must first find the specific folder where your files will be stored and managed.",
    "Click on the 'Upload' button in the top navigation bar to start the upload process.",
    "Select the file(s) you want to upload from your computer. You can usually upload multiple files at once by holding down the Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) key while selecting files.",
    "Fill in the required metadata fields. This is where you can add details like titles, descriptions, tags, and categories for your assets.",
    "Click 'Submit' to complete the upload process.",
    "Check that your files have been uploaded successfully by navigating to the folder where you uploaded them."
  ],
  "troubleshooting": [
    "File Size Limits: Ensure your files are within the size limits set by your Brandworkz settings. If they're too large, the upload might fail.",
    "Correct Formats: Double-check that you're uploading the correct file types. If you attempt to upload a format that's not supported, it won't go through.",
    "Add Metadata: While optional, adding metadata right away can save you time in the future."
