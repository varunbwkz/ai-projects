  "steps": [
    "Log in to the Brandworkz platform using your credentials.",
    "Navigate to Admin > Metadata Management to review the list of available metadata fields.",
    "Note the required fields that must be completed for each asset type. Different asset types may have different metadata requirements.",
    "When uploading a new asset, complete all the required metadata fields marked with an asterisk (*).",
    "Add values to optional fields that will help with searchability of the asset.",
    "Include keywords that describe the asset's content, purpose, and usage rights.",
    "Add any relevant taxonomies or categories to improve organization.",
    "To edit metadata for existing assets, search for and locate the asset you want to update.",
    "Select the asset to view its details, then click the 'Edit' or 'Edit Metadata' button.",
    "Make your changes to the metadata fields and save your changes.",
    "For bulk metadata editing, search for or browse to find multiple assets that need the same updates.",
    "Select all relevant assets by checking the boxes next to them.",
    "Click the 'Bulk Edit' or 'Edit Metadata' option from the actions menu.",
    "Select which metadata fields you want to update across all selected assets.",
    "Enter the new values for these fields, then confirm and save your changes. Use caution as bulk editing will overwrite existing values.",
    "To create metadata templates, navigate to Admin > Metadata Templates.",
    "Click 'Create New Template' and give your template a descriptive name.",
    "Select which asset types this template applies to.",
    "Pre-fill the metadata fields that should be applied automatically, then save your template.",
    "Templates are ideal for assets that share common metadata like campaign names, usage rights, or expiration dates."
  ],
  "troubleshooting": [
    "If you can't edit metadata, check your user permissions with your system administrator.",
    "If certain fields are greyed out, they may be system-controlled fields that cannot be edited.",
    "For required fields that have validation errors, ensure your input matches the expected format.",
    "If bulk editing seems to miss some assets, verify that all intended assets were selected before applying changes."
