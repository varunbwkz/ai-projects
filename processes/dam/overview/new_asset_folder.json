        "Select the appropriate 'Metaset' from the dropdown which determines what metadata fields will be available for assets in this folder.",
        "Add an optional 'Description' to help users understand the folder's purpose.",
        "For pages such as the Showcase Accordion, fill in any custom metadata fields that appear in the Custom Metadata section.",
        "Under Advanced Options, you can add search keywords to make the folder easier to find.",
        "You can also configure sorting of children to determine how assets within the folder will be displayed.",
        "Set a publish date if you want the folder to become visible at a specific time.",
        "Choose visibility settings to control who can access the folder (All users or System Admins only).",

    "troubleshooting": [
        "If you don't see the 'Create New Folder' button, you may not have permission to create folders in this location.",
        "If you need to modify folder permissions, contact your system administrator.",
        "Folders can only be created within standard asset folders, not within smart folders or collections.",
        "If you're trying to create a folder for a specific project, consider using Collections instead for temporary groupings.",

    "tips": [
        "Use a consistent naming convention for folders to maintain a clean, organized DAM.",
        "Keep folder structures shallow where possible to minimize the number of clicks needed to find assets.",
        "Consider adding clear descriptions to folders to help users understand what they contain.",
        "Review folder permissions regularly to ensure the right people have access to the right content.",
        "Using the Page Admin Bar method may provide additional configuration options depending on your system setup."
