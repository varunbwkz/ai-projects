    "steps": [
        "Brandworkz automatically generates visual previews for uploaded files, including Microsoft Office documents.",
        "The system attempts to create a thumbnail showing the first page of documents.",
        "For Microsoft Office documents, Brandworkz uses Microsoft's online API to generate previews.",
        "Supported file types include: doc, docx, dot, dotx, dotm, msg, odp, ods, pps, odt, ppsx, ppt, pptx, rtf, xls, xlsx, xlsm.",
        "Previews are supported for files up to 150MB in size.",
        "If a preview fails to generate automatically, you can add a custom thumbnail."
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
        "If a Microsoft Office file is larger than 150MB, it won't generate a visual preview due to Microsoft API limitations.",
        "PowerPoint Template files (.potx) are not supported for preview generation.",
        "For files where the thumbnail is not generated automatically, you can add a custom one.",
        "If you need previews for unsupported file types, consider converting them to supported formats before uploading."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "Keep Microsoft Office files under 150MB if you need visual previews.",
        "For important assets, consider adding custom thumbnails that better represent the content.",
        "When uploading multiple versions of a file, consistent thumbnails help maintain visual coherence.",
        "Custom thumbnails can be more descriptive than auto-generated ones for complex documents."
