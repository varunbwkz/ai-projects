    "steps": [
        "Add the assets you want to relate to the Side Bar by selecting them and clicking 'Add to Sidebar' in the action toolbar.",
        "Navigate to and click on the asset in the DAM page that you want to relate these assets to.",
        "Click the relate icon to establish the relationship.",
        "The assets in the Side Bar will now be related to the selected asset in the DAM (marked in grey).",
        "Note that the assets in the Side Bar will not automatically be linked to each other, only to the selected asset.",
        "When assets are related, they will appear as such in the FSAP (Full Screen Asset Preview).",
        "This helps users understand how assets should be used together, such as which logo should be used with an image or if a consent form has been supplied for an image."
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
        "If the relate icon is not visible, you may not have sufficient permissions to create asset relationships.",
        "Ensure you have added the correct assets to the Side Bar before attempting to create relationships.",
        "If you accidentally create an incorrect relationship, you can remove it by accessing the asset's details and removing the relationship.",
        "Remember that relationships are directional - assets in the Side Bar are related to the selected asset, but not necessarily vice versa."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "To relate assets in the same folder: Add all assets to the Side Bar, select the main asset in the DAM, and click the relate icon.",
        "To relate multiple assets from different folders: First relate all assets in the same folder together, then keep these in the Side Bar, navigate to the second folder, select all needed assets, and click relate.",
        "For complex relationships between many assets across multiple folders, repeat the process as required.",
        "Consider creating meaningful relationships that help users understand content connections, such as linking logos with approved images or connecting consent forms with their corresponding assets.",
        "Use asset relationships to build a network of connected content that improves discoverability and proper usage of your brand assets."
