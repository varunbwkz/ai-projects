    "steps": [
        "Identify shortcuts in the system by looking for the arrow icon in the bottom left corner of the asset thumbnail.",
        "View the path to the original asset by opening the shortcut in the Full Screen Asset Preview (FSAP).",
        "Shortcuts can be created automatically when you upload an identical asset with deduplication turned on - you'll see a warning message during upload.",
        "To manually create shortcuts from the Side Bar: Add assets to the Side Bar, navigate to the destination folder, and select 'Create Shortcut' from the options menu.",
        "To create shortcuts using the Move Button: Select the asset, click the Move button, choose the destination folder, and select the 'Create a shortcut' option.",
        "When editing a shortcut, you'll automatically be redirected to the original asset since metadata is controlled by the original.",
        "Note that only metadata fields that exist in both the original asset's metaset and the shortcut folder's metaset will be visible in the shortcut."
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
        "If you can't see the shortcut arrow icon, ensure your view settings show thumbnails at an appropriate size.",
        "If you're unable to create shortcuts, check that you have sufficient permissions for both source and destination folders.",
        "When metadata fields aren't appearing in shortcuts, verify that the fields exist in both the original asset's metaset and the shortcut folder's metaset.",
        "If automatic deduplication isn't creating shortcuts, check with your administrator that the deduplication feature is enabled."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "Use shortcuts to maintain consistent metadata across multiple instances of the same asset throughout your DAM.",
        "When organizing assets across multiple categories or departments, shortcuts allow the same asset to appear in multiple locations without duplicating storage.",
        "Remember that updating metadata on the original asset will automatically update all shortcuts.",
        "For example, if an original asset has a 'Master' metaset with both UK and US Product Codes, but a shortcut is in a folder with only UK Product Code metadata, only the UK field will be visible in the shortcut.",
        "Shortcuts are particularly useful for frequently used assets that need to appear in multiple contexts while maintaining consistent information."
