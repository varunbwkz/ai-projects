        "Select the assets you want to copy by clicking on them (use Ctrl/Cmd+click for multiple selections).",
        "Click 'Add to Sidebar' in the action toolbar to add the selected assets to your sidebar.",
        "Navigate to the destination folder where you want to paste the assets.",
        "In the sidebar, select the assets you want to paste.",
        "Click the three dots menu (...) to see available options.",
        "Choose either 'Copy' to create duplicates or 'Create Shortcut' to create references to the original assets.",
        "If you selected 'Copy', the system will create complete duplicates with their own metadata.",
        "If you selected 'Create Shortcut', the system will create references that share metadata with the original assets."
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
        "If the copy/paste options are grayed out, you may not have sufficient permissions for the destination folder.",
        "If you're unable to select multiple assets, try using Ctrl/Cmd+click or Shift+click for range selection.",
        "When copying large assets, the process may take some time to complete.",
        "If you encounter errors during copying, check that you have sufficient storage quota in your account."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "Use 'Create Shortcut' instead of 'Copy' when you want the same asset to appear in multiple locations without duplicating storage.",
        "Creating shortcuts is more efficient for metadata management as changes to the original asset's metadata will reflect in all shortcuts.",
        "When copying assets, consider whether you need completely separate copies with independent metadata.",
        "For organizational purposes, shortcuts are visually indicated in the interface to distinguish them from original assets."
