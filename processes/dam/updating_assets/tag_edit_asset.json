  "steps": [
    "Log in to your Brandworkz account to access the DAM module.",
    "Navigate to the folder containing the asset you want to edit.",
    "Click on the asset to open its details view.",
    "Look for the edit or modify option, typically represented by a pencil icon.",
    "In the edit screen, you can modify the metadata of the asset, such as adding keywords or changing other properties.",
    "For individual assets, you can change the status in the 'Modify Asset' tab by selecting 'View Only' or 'Hidden'.",
    "To add a custom thumbnail, go to the 'Modify Asset' section and look for the thumbnail upload option under the current thumbnail.",
    "If you need to update the asset while keeping all metadata, use the 'New Version' option to upload an updated file.",
    "For bulk editing, select multiple assets by checking the boxes next to them or click 'Select All'.",
    "Click the pencil tool in the asset toolbar to open the bulk edit popup.",
    "Use the Excel-style metadata management form to edit properties of multiple assets simultaneously.",
    "For fields with identical values across assets, use the 'fill down' feature by clicking the down arrow at the top of the column.",
    "You can edit a maximum of 500 assets at a time using the bulk edit feature.",
    "For extensive metadata changes, you can export metadata as an Excel spreadsheet using the export option.",
    "Edit the exported spreadsheet in Excel, maintaining its original structure.",
    "Import the modified spreadsheet back into Brandworkz to update the metadata for the affected assets.",
    "Save your changes when finished to apply all modifications.",
    "For hierarchical metadata fields, look for the hierarchical icon to select from the appropriate metasets.",
    "Date fields will provide a calendar popup for easy date selection.",
    "The bulk edit tool includes undo and redo functionality for your convenience."
  ],
  "troubleshooting": [
    "If you cannot see the edit option, check if you have the necessary permissions to modify assets.",
    "When bulk editing, remember that you are limited to 500 assets at a time.",
    "If custom thumbnails don't appear immediately after uploading, try refreshing the page.",
    "When importing metadata, ensure your spreadsheet maintains the exact structure of the exported file to avoid import errors.",
    "If status changes don't seem to be working, check with your administrator about your permission levels.",
    "For bulk editing issues, try working with smaller batches of assets if you experience performance problems."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Use keywords consistently across assets to improve searchability.",
    "Consider using the AI-assisted keyword suggestions if available in your system.",
    "Regular metadata maintenance improves the overall usability of your asset library.",
    "Custom thumbnails can significantly improve the visual browsing experience for users.",
    "When uploading new versions, consider adding a note about what changed in the new version.",
    "Use the 'Select columns to display' option in bulk edit to customize which metadata fields are visible.",
    "Status changes can be automated using the System Metadata fields 'Expiry Date' and 'Publish Date'.",
    "Exporting metadata is particularly useful for making extensive changes in an offline environment."
