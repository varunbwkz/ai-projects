  "steps": [
    "Log in to your Brandworkz account to access the DAM module.",
    "Choose one of the following export methods based on your needs and permissions:",
    "For Full Asset Folder Export (System Admin Only):",
    "- Navigate to the desired folder",
    "- Hover over 'More' in the bottom admin bar",
    "- Select 'export tags and metadata'",
    "For Selected Assets Export (All Users):",
    "- Navigate to the desired folder",
    "- Either click 'select all' or manually select specific assets",
    "- Click the 'export tags and metadata' icon in the top action bar",
    "For Search Results Export (All Users):",
    "- Perform a search for the desired assets",
    "- Use filters if needed to refine results",
    "- Select the assets you want to export",
    "- Click the 'export tags and metadata' icon in the top action bar",
    "If assets use different metasets:",
    "- You'll be taken to a screen to export per metaset",
    "- Click on each metaset to access its export page",
    "On the Export Screen:",
    "- Choose the export format (Excel Spreadsheet or HTML table)",
    "- Select the metadata and technical information fields to export",
    "- Ensure 'Serial Number' is selected (mandatory)",
    "- Include 'Title' field (recommended for future imports)",
    "- Make sure the folder name is selected to avoid errors",
    "- Click 'Submit' to generate the export",
    "When opening the Excel file:",
    "- Accept the popup about file format",
    "- Save the file as an Excel Workbook for future use"
  ],
  "troubleshooting": [
    "If you receive an error during export, verify that the folder name is selected in the export options.",
    "If you can't see the export option, check if you have the necessary permissions.",
    "For system-wide exports, ensure you have System Admin privileges.",
    "If the Excel file shows format warnings, this is normal - just accept and resave as an Excel Workbook.",
    "If planning to re-import the data later, make sure you've included the Title field in the export.",
    "The export function only works with assets - it cannot export W2P template tags."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Always export the Title field even though it's not marked as mandatory - it's required for future imports.",
    "Use the search and filter options to precisely select assets before exporting.",
    "Consider exporting to HTML format if you only need to view the data.",
    "Export in smaller batches if you're experiencing performance issues.",
    "Keep track of which metasets you're exporting when dealing with multiple asset types.",
    "Regular exports can help with metadata quality control and asset management.",
    "Save a backup of the exported file before making any modifications.",
    "Use this feature to audit asset metadata and ensure consistency across your library."
