  "keywords": ["move assets", "relocate files", "change folder", "asset management", "folder organization", "file organization", "asset location"],
  "steps": [
    "Log in to your Brandworkz account to access the DAM module.",
    "Navigate to the folder containing the assets you want to move.",
    "Select one or multiple assets that you wish to move.",
    "Click the move icon in the asset admin bar.",
    "In the folder navigation tree that appears, browse to your target destination folder.",
    "Click the 'Move' button to confirm and execute the move operation.",
    "Verify that your assets appear in the new destination folder."
  ],
  "troubleshooting": [
    "If you moved assets to the wrong folder, repeat the process to move them back.",
    "Ensure you have the necessary permissions to move assets and access both source and destination folders.",
    "If the move icon is not visible, check if you have the required permissions for moving assets.",
    "Verify that all selected assets were successfully moved to the new location."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "You can move multiple assets at once - there is no limit to the number of assets that can be moved simultaneously.",
    "Double-check the destination folder before confirming the move to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.",
    "Consider organizing assets in a logical folder structure to make future moves more efficient.",
    "Moving assets doesn't affect their metadata or relationships - only their location changes."
