        "Select the assets you wish to share by clicking on them in the DAM.",
        "Click the 'Share' button in the asset admin bar at the top of the page.",
        "Choose your preferred sharing method: 'Send email' or 'Create link'.",
        "For Email sharing: Select 'Send email' from the dropdown menu.",
        "Add recipients - for registered users, their email will appear automatically; for external users, type the email and click 'add'.",
        "Select the download options you want to apply to all shared assets.",
        "Edit the subject line and message of the email as needed.",
        "Input valid from and to dates to set when the share will be available.",
        "Click 'Share' to send the email with links to the assets.",
        "For Link sharing: Select 'Create link' from the dropdown menu.",
        "Choose the download options you'd like the end user to have access to.",
        "Set any valid from and to dates to control access duration.",
        "Click 'Create Link' to generate the sharing link.",
        "Copy the auto-generated link and share it via your preferred method."
    ],
    "troubleshooting": [
        "If the recipient doesn't receive the sharing email, check if the email address was entered correctly.",
        "If the share link doesn't work, verify that the valid dates are still current.",
        "Note that shared assets are static - you can't update the share to add or remove assets after creation.",
        "Download options apply to all assets in the share - you cannot set different options for individual assets in the same share."
    ],
    "tips": [
        "Use email sharing when you know exactly who needs access to the assets.",
        "Use link sharing when you need to distribute access through other channels or to multiple people.",
        "For more flexibility with managing assets over time, consider using albums instead of shares.",
        "Set appropriate expiration dates for security when sharing with external parties.",
        "Select appropriate download options based on the recipient's needs and your security requirements."
