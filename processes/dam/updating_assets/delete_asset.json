  "steps": [
    "Log in to your Brandworkz account to access the DAM module.",
    "Navigate to the folder containing the asset(s) you want to delete.",
    "Select the asset(s) you wish to delete by checking the box next to them.",
    "Locate the delete option in the asset admin bar.",
    "Click the delete button to initiate the deletion process.",
    "Review the alert message: 'Are you sure you want to permanently delete these asset(s) from the system?'",
    "At this point, you have two options:",
    "Option 1: Click 'Delete' to permanently remove the asset(s) from the system.",
    "Option 2: Choose 'Disable' instead to make the asset(s) inaccessible without permanently deleting them.",
    "If you chose to delete, confirm your decision when prompted.",
    "Wait for the deletion process to complete."

  "troubleshooting": [
    "If you cannot see the delete option, verify that you have the necessary permissions to delete assets.",
    "If you accidentally initiated deletion, you can cancel the process before confirming.",
    "If you're unsure about permanent deletion, consider using the 'Disable' option instead.",
    "Remember that deleted assets cannot be retrieved once the deletion is confirmed.",
    "If you need to delete multiple assets, ensure all selected assets are meant to be deleted before proceeding."
  ],
  "tips": [
    "Consider disabling assets instead of deleting them if you might need them in the future.",
    "Always double-check your selection before confirming deletion.",
    "For bulk deletions, review the list of selected assets carefully.",
    "Keep in mind that deletion is permanent and cannot be undone.",
    "If an asset is referenced by other content, consider the impact of deletion on those references.",
    "Regular cleanup of unused assets can help maintain system performance and storage space.",
    "Document any important asset deletions for future reference.",
    "Consider exporting asset metadata before deletion if you need to maintain records."
